## Compiling from source ##
Compile phc-win with the directory option with the old version of phc-win (http://wiki.swiftlytilting.com/phc-win).

Copy into top of REDIST folder.

A better method is being worked on.

## Notice ##
All source builds will have required .inc.php files in ./lib/includes/ for easy coding, and not having too recompile most of the time.
Main builds will integrate them.

## Decompilation ##
As this is turned into byte-code, decompiling is not possible, except ASM.
